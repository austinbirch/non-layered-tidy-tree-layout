# non-layered-tidy-tree-js

Draw non-layered tidy trees in linear time.

> This a JavaScript port from the project [cwi-swat/non-layered-tidy-trees](https://github.com/cwi-swat/non-layered-tidy-trees), which is written in Java. The algorithm used in that project is from the paper by _A.J. van der Ploeg_, [Drawing Non-layered Tidy Trees in Linear Time](http://oai.cwi.nl/oai/asset/21856/21856B.pdf). There is another JavaScript port from that project [d3-flextree](https://github.com/Klortho/d3-flextree), which depends on _d3-hierarchy_. This project is dependency free.
